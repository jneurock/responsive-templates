## Running the demo locally

Clone or fork this repo. The `master` branch contains the Ember-CLI version of the application. The `viking-base` branch contains a non-Ember-CLI version built with [Viking Base](https://github.com/jneurock/viking-base).

Checkout whichever branch works best for you. Keep in mind that the Ember-CLI version is modular and uses some ES6 syntax whereas the Viking Base version uses a global `App` instance of the Ember application.
